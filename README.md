# Top Courses (React + API)

A simple, responsive courses explorer that fetches course data via an API and lets users browse and filter popular courses across categories with a clean, card-based UI.

- Live site: https://arnavbhatiamait.github.io/top-courses/[1]
- Repository (gh-pages branch): arnavbhatiamait/top-courses at gh-pages[1]

## Features

- Browse curated “top courses” pulled dynamically from an API.[1]
- Category filters to switch between domains (e.g., Web, Data, DevOps).[1]
- Clean, mobile-friendly UI with course cards.[1]
- Deployed on GitHub Pages.[1]

## Tech Stack

3) Configure API
- If the project fetches from a public JSON endpoint or local JSON, confirm the API/base URL in the code and adjust if needed.[1]

4) Run locally
